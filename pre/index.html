## Practical intro to Golang

Tomáš Karásek

Coding Sauna 28.3.2022 @TribeTampere

---

## Design Goals
- Go combines the development speed of working in a dynamic language like Python with the performance and safety of a compiled language like C or C++
- Developed in Google to address the needs of Internet services (fast change, dependencies, concurrency)
- Simple to learn and use (familiar syntax, garbage collection, static linking, light OOP, easy tooling)

---

## Technical Characteristics

- (open `/hello` in vscode)
- Compiled (Code -> Executable binary for target platform)
- Golang code is linked statically
- Compiled binaries have little dependencies
- Pointers, garbage-collected
- Very low-level, but has concurency and `map` in core (unlike C,C++ and Java)

---

## Popularity

- Well paid ([2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#work-salary-and-experience-by-language), [2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-top-paying-technologies-top-paying-technologies)), loved ([2020](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-languages-loved), [2021](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-language-love-dread)), but [still not there](https://octoverse.github.com/#top-languages-over-the-years)
- Supported in [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/), in [Google Cloud Functions](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/create-deploy-go)

---

## Tooling
- most come as subcommands in the same binary as the compiler
- go build - compiler
- go mod - dependency management
- go fmt - formatter  (show in `/hello/`)
- go test - testing  (show in `/hello/`)
- go doc - generates HTML documentation


---

## Coding example `/tickers/`

- show [BTC-USD order book on Coinbase](https://pro.coinbase.com/trade/BTC-USD)
- show API get of BTC-USD from Coinbase
- getting JSON from API, struct, tags, json.Unmarshal
- CoinbaseGetter BTC-USD
- print prices from more exchange 
- print prices from more exchange concurrently
- compute average concurrently
- compare times for sync and async

---

## Written in Go

Usually sysadmin, "DevOps" tools

- Kubernetes, Docker
- Prometheus, Influxdb
- Terraform, any software from HashiCorp

---

## vs Java, C++, Python

- no classes, no inheritance, but struct can be composed, and can have "methods"
- Java: no VM, map, concurrency out of the box
- C++: garbage col, static linking, no generics until recently
- Python: static typing, compiled, concurrency, faster
